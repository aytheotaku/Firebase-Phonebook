# WorkingWithFirebase
This is a phonebook made with Materialize and Firebase's Firestore.
I've heard a lot as Firebase as a BaaS and wanted to really learn what it is and make something with it.
I only used the it's Firestore product to implement basic CRD operations using a cloud database.
I'll use it's other products such as Authentication and Analytics in some other projects God willing.

- Have fun breaking it :)
